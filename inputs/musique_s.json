( the limitation of their number to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea. ) besides the olympians, the greeks worshipped various gods of the countryside, the satyr - god pan, nymphs ( spirits of rivers ), naiads ( who dwelled in springs ), dryads ( who were spirits of the trees ), nereids ( who inhabited the sea ), river gods, satyrs, and others. in addition, there were the dark powers of the underworld, such as the erinyes ( or furies ), said to pursue those guilty of crimes against blood - relatives. in order to honor the ancient greek pantheon, poets composed the homeric hymns ( a group of thirty - three songs ). gregory nagy regards ` ` the larger homeric hymns as simple preludes ( compared with theogony ), each of which invokes one god''. there is no unanimous agreement among scholars on the structure of exodus. one strong possibility is that it is a diptych ( i. e., divided into two parts ), with the division between parts 1 and 2 at the crossing of the red sea or at the beginning of the theophany ( appearance of god ) in chapter 19. on this plan, the first part tells of god's rescue of his people from egypt and their journey under his care to sinai ( chapters 1 - - 19 ) and the second tells of the covenant between them ( chapters 20 - - 40 ). princess louise came to russia in november 1792, when she was chosen by empress catherine ii of russia as a bride for her eldest grandson, grand duke alexander pavlovich of russia, the future tsar alexander i. louise converted to the orthodox church, took the title of grand duchess of russia and traded the name louise maria for elizabeth alexeievna. she married alexander on 28 september 1793, when he was fifteen and she was fourteen. initially the marriage was happy. elizabeth was beautiful, but shy and withdrawn."

( the limitation of their number to twelve seems to have been a comparatively modern idea. ) besides the olympians, the greeks worshipped various gods of the countryside, the satyr - god pan, nymphs ( spirits of rivers ), naiads ( who dwelled in springs ), dryads ( who were spirits of the trees ), nereids ( who inhabited the sea ), river gods, satyrs, and others. in addition, there were the dark powers of the underworld, such as the erinyes ( or furies ), said to pursue those guilty of crimes against blood - relatives. in order to honor the ancient greek pantheon, poets composed the homeric hymns ( a group of thirty - three songs ). gregory nagy regards ` ` the larger homeric hymns as simple preludes ( compared with theogony ), each of which invokes one god''. there is no unanimous agreement among scholars on the structure of exodus. one strong possibility is that it is a diptych ( i. e., divided into two parts ), with the division between parts 1 and 2 at the crossing of the red sea or at the beginning of the theophany ( appearance of god ) in chapter 19. on this plan, the first part tells of god's rescue of his people from egypt and their journey under his care to sinai ( chapters 1 - - 19 ) and the second tells of the covenant between them ( chapters 20 - - 40 ). princess louise came to russia in november 1792, when she was chosen by empress catherine ii of russia as a bride for her eldest grandson, grand duke alexander pavlovich of russia, the future tsar alexander i. louise converted to the orthodox church, took the title of grand duchess of russia and traded the name louise maria for elizabeth alexeievna. she married alexander on 28 september 1793, when he was fifteen and she was fourteen. initially the marriage was happy. elizabeth was beautiful, but shy and withdrawn. she had two daughters, but both died in early childhood. during the reign of her father - in - law, tsar paul i, elizabeth"
